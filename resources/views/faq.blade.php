            <div class="content">
            <p>Your venue coordinator most likely has many clients and many upcoming events she is juggling simultaneously, possibly several per month. Most onsite venue coordinators are just too busy to devote the time and attention necessary to attend to the details of your wedding. The bottom line: A wedding coordinator at a venue and a wedding planner are two completely different jobs. The venue wedding coordinator is there to serve the venue. A planner is completely focused on you and dedicated to your wedding vision, and she is there solely to make sure that you vision comes to life on your wedding day. </p>

            <p>Your planner will be the go-to point person on your wedding day, but will likely bring at least one assistant with them the day of your wedding, possibly two in order to ensure that your day unfolds flawlessly.</p>
